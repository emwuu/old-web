		<h1> Picnic </h1>
		<h3>ピックニック</h3>
		<div> March 31, 2018 </div>
		<div> Another full day without any obligations whatsoever - For meals, I raided the convenience store (again). I suspect I'll be tired of the food by the end of the program, but right now I'm completely satisfied.  There's a baseball field with a row of cherry trees nearby - a nice spot we chose for a spontaneous spring picnic. <br><Br>

		It's a chilly day, and I know I didn't pack enough warm clothes. I only thought of sweaty summers, not a spring colder than San Diego's winter. What helps is that convenience stores are not only stocked with cold drinks, there's also a section for heated coffees, milk teas, and... other things. <br><br>

		Unfortunately none of my selections were very good, but the thrill of trying something new is worth it. And there is always something new to try.<br></div>

		<p> Hot lemon - this is a sickly sweet cross between gatorade and lemonade, not the honey lemon tea I was hoping for!</p>

		<p> Greasy noodles but with lots of veggies - 426 yen (~ 4.50 USD)</p>

		<div> There's a small produce store owned by an old couple down the street from the nearest 7-11. It's the most chaotic, hot mess of a business I have ever seen.  Half of the store contains produce and the other half looks like a junkyard with random, single pots and pans, but surprisingly neat packets of city-ordained trash bags. You have to wade through boxes of ugly potatoes and cabbages to get to the produce fridge.  There's a freezer with iced over gari-gari kuns (popsicles) that looks like it's been there for years. Everything is in cardboard boxes, prices and source location labeled with a black marker. I checked my purchases thoroughly, so as to not buy something overripe or moldy.  <br><br>

		It's a mess, but it's cheap, so I actually find everything endearing rather than a headache. </div>

		<p> A walk through a different part of the neighborhood revealed another shrine, tucked charmingly in a corner. </p>

		<div> My throat feels scratchy and I feel signs of an impending cold, so it's good to have a relaxing day to rest.</div><br>
