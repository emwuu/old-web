		<h1> Boring Logistics and Daiso </h1>
		<h3> つまらない兵站学とダイソー</h3>
		<div> March 30, 2018 </div>
		<div> There's evidently a lot of paperwork and hoops to jump through as a short term resident of Japan. Volunteers from our university helped us get registered with the prefecture, open a bank account, and set up auto pay for some bills, including the National Health Insurance. Honestly, all of this stuff was a blur. I just signed on the dotted line and did what people told me to do. Sorry, that's probably not an adult thing to do, but I'll make the concession because I can't communicate in Japanese sufficiently for this kind of business, and it's the University's International Student Support Office's job to help us suckers out. <br><br>

		Japanese people actually typically carry around a hankou (stamp) for authentication instead of using signatures. However, since we are foreigners, they make the allowance. While filling out our forms, we had to be very exact and follow precise instructions. Else, they would hand us a new form and tell us (nicely) to start over. <Br><br>

		The prefectural office, (or whatever our first stop of the day was), was literally the DMV. Their cubicles are a little more out in the open than the American DMV, and in fact, this is how the Japan Post offices and banks are oriented as well. You're given a number and wait until you're called. And wait we did. It must've taken us 2.5 hours to finish our business at the prefectural office, and that was just our first stop of the day.<br><Br>

		The experience was interesting and not interesting at the same time. What was more interesting was that since we had business with the prefectural office, we were also in downtown Sendai! There's a lot of shoutengai (covered shopping malls), department stores, and restaurants. It definitely packs a big city feel. <br><br>

		Daiso in America has nothing on Daiso in Japan. We located a 7 floor Daiso selling cheap, convenient items in every category possible. They sell cleaning supplies, stationary, snacks, laundry supplies, cooking utensils (although, I don't recommend getting pots and pans here) , eating utensils, pet supplies and so much more. The part that surprised me the most was that each item is 108 yen (as opposed to 150 yen). Because of the import costs, things at the Daiso in America tend to not be worth the money. But things here are definitely, very much worth the money. Moving to a new place is annoying because even if I'm only here for a short term, there's still so many things that I need to get me through 4 months. However, if there's any place that can ease that pain, it's Japan. Daiso was definitely a life saver!  </div>
