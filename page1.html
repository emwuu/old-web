		<h1> To Japan!</h1>
		<h3> 日本へ！</h3>
		<div> March 26, 2018 </div>
		<div class="right-text"> Even in the weeks leading up to my departure, the fact that I was going to study abroad in Japan still seemed surreal. Despite having already paid for the plane ticket, tuition, and fees, I kept on telling my friends that I didn't believe it would happen- that someone would die or that some catastrophe would keep me from going. <br> <br>

		But nothing did! After a week-long whirlwind of hobbling through finals (the last and most painful) saying goodbye to college friends, moving out of my apartment, making the 8 hour trek back home to the Bay Area (the Central Valley is sooooo beautiful!) , sitting in on some weird investment dinner (why, Dad?), purchasing a new phone (I'm now an iPhone user!) , hanging out with family and friends, and packing, I was finally flying out of SFO! It was a busy a week!

		<div class="right-text"> On my flight, I finally got to watch Coco. Movie tickets are around $20 where I live, so it was a nice to see a good one for "free". I didn't see any other interesting movies so I dozed off and stared in to space for most of the flight. <br><br>

		I had a short layover in Taiwan, which afforded me some time to explore. I love Asian airports! Not only are there a wide variety Asian snacks like Taiwanese pineapple cake, there are also a lot of interesting exhibits scattered throughout the airport terminal. There was an art exhibit displaying dozens of beautiful paper lanterns, a small exhibit about the Taiwanese indigneous peoples, a mini playground for children, and other mildly interesting things to look at. There were even prayer rooms for different religions! </div>

		<div>Getting on the plane from Taiwan to Japan, I bothered the man sitting next to me a lot. First, when boarding, I stubbornly said I was okay when he offered to help me with my luggage. However, as I gracelessly shoved my luggage in the overhead cabin, I crushed his bag. He had to come reposition my bag to rescue his own. Next, he poked me awake because I slept through the meal. Finally, when I opened my lunch, the foil lid covering my food slipped into his lap, resulting in an oil stain on his jeans. After that, I was too afraid to even look at him, but I was thinking that he was a pretty cool guy. He talked to me in Mandarin, was speaking seemingly flawless Japanese to the stewardesses, and was reading English on his tablet. I wondered what he did for a living, but was too afraid to ask. It also turns out he's a really forgiving guy, because he retrieved my lugggage from the overhead cabinet. Thank you stranger! <br><br>

		Thanks to some really great instructions from our study abroad program advisors, touching down and getting business done was pretty painless. If you're coming in on a student visa, you have to stand in a separate line to get your residence card at immigration. After doing so, I exchanged a bit of cash and forwarded my luggage to my dorm room (such an amazing service!), and then bought my train tickets into the REAL Tokyo. (Narita Airport is actually in Chiba) On the train ride from the airport, giddiness bubbled up in my chest. I couldn't believe that I was finally here! Everything was foreign, but within my expectations. The train announcements of all things got me really pumped up. They sounded exactly like the practice recordings we used to practice with in Japanese class (which I am so, so thankful for). <br><br>

		Through the window, I watched fields of green whiz by. I grinned when I saw the distinctively red and white transmission towers in the distance because they reminded me of a certain scene from Haikyuu... <br> <br>

		Having to navigate the transportation system immediately upon arrival was daunting, but things went relatively smoothly. There was a slight hiccup where I got 特速 and 快速 confused, but everything worked out.<br><br>

		After checking in to my hotel at 6PM, I climbed in to bed to take a "short nap" before heading out to get dinner. Unsurprisingly, when I woke up, it was in the middle of the night. Oops! Looks like I will still have to struggle with jet lag...<br><br>

		After months of planning, logistics, scholarship applications, and seizures of excitement for this moment, I'm finally here!!!!! Hello, Musashisakai, Tokyo! <div>
