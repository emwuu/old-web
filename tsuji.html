		<h1> Sakura Sightseeing: Tsutsujigaoka Park </h1>
		<h3> 花見： 榴ヶ岡</h3>
		<div> April 10-11, 2018 </div>

			Alas - ! The sakura season is so famous but so transient! Although, from a tourist standpoint, if you started from the southernmost tip of Japan and followed the cherry blossoms all the way to Hokkaido, the season appears to be considerably long. However, the blooms don't peak more than a week at any given location. And how precious that week is! Cherry blossoms are so evocatively beautiful that despite its short lifespan it truly is a symbol of spring and of new beginnings.

     	<div class="right-text"> Anyways, once I realized that these flowers weren't going to stick around for long, I began panic googling the most popular local cherry blossom spots. As I'm still in my first couple weeks here, I was torn between staying in lab longer to make a good first impression or basking in the full glory of a Japanese spring. (I think you can guess which choice I made) Actually, my internal dilemma was so great, that I arrived at the park a little after sunset. Even in the dim light, I was astounded by the variety of cherry blossoms at Tsutsujigaoka Park. Unlike the cherry blossom trees by the Ogawara river, these came in many varieties, with colors ranging from white to magenta. It was a treat to soak in the environment - the bustling food stalls, the mellow glow from the strings of lanterns shedding spheres of gold in to sakura branches, blue tarps sprawled under the trees seating boisterously drinking coworkers and picnicking families...</div>

     	<div> Night fell too soon, so I decided I had to come again to enjoy the cherry blossoms in daylight. So the very next day I abashedly snuck out of lab even earlier to enjoy the full color of the trees, as well as the rest of the park. <br><br></div>

     	<div> It's a nice feeling, to stand at the periphery, the ending of one season looking forward to the beginning of another. Seasons in San Diego bleed in to each other, with very few visual cues to signify change. Yet in Sendai, when spring comes, flowers boldly burst forth, disrupting barren surroundings with captivating beauty. Though the vestiges of winter chill still nipped at my fingertips, seeing the frigid wind sweep petals across the ground was such a delicate yet rapturously beautiful sight. <br><br></div>

     	<p> Sights from the rest of the park</p>


     	<div>
     	I stayed in the park a long time after nightfall; I couldn't stop drinking in the sight of hanami! But eventually my cold fingers coaxed me home. On my way back, I stopped by for a steaming hot pizza bun (quickly becoming one of my go-to snacks from the convenience store). These days have been so good!</div><br>

     	<p> Cheesy, saucy goodness in a steamed bun wrapper. Sooo good! Available at any convenience store </p>
