		<div> March 27, 2018 </div>

		<div> Because I'm still jet-lagged, my mornings start pretty early. However, it just so happens that the city wakes up early too. Trains start moving around 5 in the morning, and because the sun rises about an hour earlier here, it's actually pretty bright at around 5 am. The hotel I'm staying at, Citytel, is a business hotel located near the Musashisakai Station. The director of the Japan UCEAP Study Center described Musashisakai as the "countryside of Tokyo", and indeed, it feels very suburban. <br> <br>

		I feel like the mere existence of business hotels is fascinating and is very indicative of Japanese work culture. They are meant for long nights, when someone works so late that they have missed all the trains and need last minute lodging. They aren't cheap either, I paid around $75 per night, and it's both less aesthetically appealing and less comfortable than Motel 6. <br><br></div>

		<div>The sounds of Musashisakai in the morning are quite interesting. I'm staying near the station, and musical jingles are constantly played to indicate the train arrivals. Announcements that I don't understand are loudly broadcasted in polite Japanese. Despite the busyness of the morning, it is oddly quiet. Only the echoing announcements and the solemn clacking of heels on pavement ring through the square, as men and women in suits stream toward the station. <br><br>

		It feels odd to walk in the city during this rush hour. Everyone is walking purposefully toward the station. I am walking away from it. First, I go to multiple convenience stores, meandering in and out of bakeries in search for some breakfast. Then, I explore the suburbs, walking through narrow streets, taking long lingering looks at the plants decorating house fronts, the net of electrical wires hanging above, and the clinics and stores. It's odd because although the streets feel very suburban, every other house is a home business. Signs indicating childcare, restaurants, cleaning, hair styling, and clinics are posted on house fronts all the way down the street. <br><br> </div>

		I'm here in Musashisakai for UCEAP (University of California Education Abroad Program) orientation at International Christian University. It's currently sakura season, and sakura are full bloom in Tokyo. It's nice to be able to see this upon our arrival here. There is one sakura lined road that is particularly beautiful at ICU.

		<div> We also ate at ICU's dining commons for lunch. This is shogayaki-don (ginger pork) and was very delicious! </div>
