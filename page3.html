		<h1> My New Home in Sendai </h1>
		<h3> 仙台へ：私の新しい家</h3>
		<div> March 28, 2018 </div>

		<div> Today, my friends and I rode the shinkansen to Sendai, where we will be attending university. The Tohoku Shinkansen can complete the 230 mile trip from Tokyo to Sendai in 1.5 hours, but will also set you back around $100 USD, so it looks like I won't be frequenting Tokyo much. However, it was definitely a smooth and comfortable experience. <div>

		<div>Sendai is the biggest city in the the Tohoku Region of Japan, and it has a huge JR station. Obviously, it doesn't compare to Ikebukuro or Tokyo stations, but when you walk out, you're greeted with a lattice of sky walkways and a booming city center. With its broad streets and numerous multi-floor department stores, Sendai definitely has a big city feel. </div>

		<p> Riding a bus to our dorm. It's 30 minutes from downtown Sendai. </p>

		<div> I live in International House 1, where everyone is a foreign student and has a separate room. Below is a presentation of my dorm room! Nothing is actually new, but everything is impressively clean. The dorm itself is over 50 years old; there are noticeable scuffs and cracks on the walls and floor. The hallways make the dorm look like an abandoned, haunted hospital. But the rooms are cozy enough. I really like that I have my own gas stove and fridge! I'm used to having two roommates, but now I have a spacious single to my lonesome self. </div>

		<div> My friends and I met up after our respective dorm orientations to try and grab dinner. We tried to hit up 3 or 4 different restaurants but they were all closed. It's presumably because we live in a residential area with a lot of students, and school is still on break. Finally, we stumbled upon a family restaurant that we immediately fell in love with. The restaurant owner was very motherly - very welcoming and kind! </div>

		<div> Delicious ハンバーグ　(hamburger steak) from Ma-san. It was tender and juicy. The sauce was a sweet garlic soy sauce that reminds me of what my mom used to marinate pork chops with. Also came with miso soup, a mouthful of spaghetti, and some potatoes. I really liked the light texture of shredded cabbage. </div>
