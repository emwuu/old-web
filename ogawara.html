		<h1> Sakura Sightseeing: Ogawara </h1>
		<h3> 花見：大河原</h3>
		<div> April 9, 2018 </div>
		<div class="right-text">I heard about Ogawara through a church event I wasn’t able to attend, but figured that if a church decided to go there for an outting, it must be some place special. Ogawara is about an hour away by train from campus, so in want of some good company during the lengthy ride, I texted some friends to see if they were free to go. <Br><br>
     	Ogawara appears to be a tiny remote town, known solely for its sakura festival, featuring a long river lined with cherry blossom trees as far as the eye can see. On a clear day, you can even see snow capped mountains in the distance.<br>

		<div> It honestly felt wrong (although I didn't skip any classes), to be carefree and hanging out on a Monday afternoon. We walked along the river, enjoying the blooms. From a distance, the branches, laden with white, were taking on a brown tinge as new leaves were sprouting in. The trees were a little past peak, but they were lovely all the same. I liked to look closely at the branches, at the individual bunches of flowers so that the colors wouldn't blend.  <br><br></div>

		<div>The sky was grey and the wind was bitingly cold so we went to the food stalls to warm up and try as much festival food as we desired. I picked up some steaming roast corn and a piping hot bowl of oden, while some of my friends tried sakura sake and stick after stick of konnyaku. The warmth from the food didn't stick with us for long, and the girls in our group resorted to huddling together for body heat. </div>

		<div> After sunset, lanterns and white LED lights illuminated the cherry blossoms, erasing the brown tinge of the trees. I couldn't stop taking pictures because I was so taken by the network of branches over our heads, even though each picture turned out virtually the same.<Br><br></div>

		<div>One of my friends commented "Yeah, this is what studying abroad should be about" and I wholeheartedly agree. It was nice to completely drink in the essence of our host country, with the added glee of doing it on school day. <br>
     	Chilled to the bone but happy, we finally left Ogawara long after it got dark.  <br><br></div>
