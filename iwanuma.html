		On a Saturday, my Japanese culture class took a field-trip to Iwanuma to plant trees as part of a tsunami recovery volunteer event. <br><br></div>

    	<div>Iwanuma suffered heavy damage from the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake and subsequent tsunami. It was hard to imagine that the land we were standing on was once a populated town, given that as far as the eye could see, there was only dirt, trees, and the occasional hill shaped mound. The elements that remained were pieced together in a landscape that looked uniform and intentionally designed, but the reality was anything but; the tsunami had forcefully smashed this coastside community, leaving an unpopulated area exuding an aura of peaceful disquiet.<br><br></div>

    	<div>We later learned that the odd mounds were constructed from debris that had washed up on their shores. The garbage was arranged in neat piles and packed over with dirt. In Iwanuma, the waves reached a height of 9 meters. At 11 meters, these mounds are equipped with emergency supplies, and are to serve as evacuation centers- a high ground for people to run to in case of a disaster. Along with the trees we were to plant that day, they are also supposed to act as barriers to impede the lethal force of future waves, should a tsunami as tragic as the one in 2011 occur again. </div><br><br>

    	<div>It was a bright ebullient day to be outside. We participated in an "entrance ceremony" with other volunteers -- some were school groups, wearing PE uniforms, others looked like expert tree planting volunteers; decked out in rainboots, gardening gloves, visors, and brightly colored outdoor wear. We stood in lines in our respective groups and listened to different speeches and thank yous as we sipped proffered water, apple juice and green tea. <br><br>
    	As it turns out, many more volunteers showed up than anticipated so there were actually not that many trees for us to plant. A spry, white-haired man (a professor at Tohoku University, I later learned) patiently instructed us in how to plant trees. First, we soaked the potted saplings in water, until after all the air bubbles had successfully been filled with water. Then, we dug holes big enough to fit the saplings with several inches on all sides. After wrestling the saplings out of their pots, we placed them in to the holes and refilled them with dirt, pushing them in to the ground. Finally, we covered the newly planted saplings with hay, and tied them down with rope. </div>

    	<div>We managed to wrap everything up in only a couple hours, but the dirt and wooden posts to tie the hay down had been prepared by someone previously, and the saplings were lovingly raised by elementary schools for 1-2 years. Given that we were provided lunch (two onigiri with some pickled veggies), and even managed to pick up some free shirts, I felt like we were treated too nicely for the little work we did! </div>
    	<div>Afterwards, we went to see the ocean. The entire coast is blocked off by a concrete embankment, almost completely obstructing the ocean from view if you're on flat ground. Climbing the embankment unveils no La Jolla beach- instead, another comb-like structure was unveiled, yet another preventative measure against future tsunamis. </div>

    	<p>On the concrete embankment.</p>

    	<div>As we stood on the embankment admiring the view, our (old) professor went down to the beach and started climbing the comb like structure. We incredulously looked after him, and one student said aloud "We can do that!?" I think all of us were secretly suppressing our inner desire to do the exact same thing. Living in Japan, I've gotten this kind of pressure-to-be-polite-and-not-offend quite often and sometimes it subdues any boldness I might feel. It's interesting, and I can see it affecting other people as well.</div>

    	<div>The structure was actually quite treacherous to climb, giving me a tiny shot of adrenaline (well, I'm not the super adventurous type) but it was an easy and fun physical challenge. I enjoyed taking pictures of my friends, climbing on and sitting on the interesting shape of the barrier, watching the water rush in and rush out of the cracks of the structure 3 feet beneath me.  </div>

		<div>It was a bright, harrowing, rewarding, somber, exhilarating, tranquil day that I will remember for a long time.</div>

		<div>After we were released from our volunteering field trip, my friends and I went out to dinner. Again, there isn't much around where we live, so we chose to eat at an izakaya, which sold mainly drinks and yakitori (chicken on a stick). The dining experience was largely underwhelming and pretty pricey. So pricey, that we started opening random snacks that we had happened to acquire on our way to dinner, in the restaurant. It ended up being more of a snack feast than a dinner. I contributed a can of "cider potato chips", which tasted like sprite (yes, the soda) flavored pringles, which I had bought for 100 yen at the chaotically messy produce store nearby. Even though the dining experience was less than satisfactory, it was a good time of talking and hanging out with friends.  </div>
