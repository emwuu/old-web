		<h1> Church at Lifehouse Sendai </h1>
		<h3>ライフハウス仙台の教会</h3>
		<div> March 31, 2018 </div>
		<div> It's Sunday, which means Sunday service! <br><br>

		Finding a church is an immensely important part of my study abroad experience. I don't want my faith to slip, being so far away people who can hold me accountable and keep me focused on what I believe is important. A big reason why I wanted to come to Japan was to know more about its spiritual climate and engage in conversations about faith. I made sure that churches existed in Sendai before applying to the program at Tohoku University. <br><br>

		Today, I checked out <a href="https://sendai.mylifehouse.com/en/"> Lifehouse Sendai</a>, near the heart of Sendai city. Which means-- back to Sendai Station!<br><br></div>

		<p> The service was located on the 5th floor of the Michinokutei building. Upon exiting the elevator, I was greeted with this sign, which made me smile. </p>

		<div> On Sundays, this floor is a church by day, and an izakaya (a bar/restaurant establishment) by night.<br><br><br>

		Lifehouse is an international church, and it's no problem at all for English-only speakers. The worship music has English verses and Japanese verses, with romanji displayed for English speakers to still participate during the Japanese verses. Sermons are always in both languages, translated real time. <Br><br><br>

		The size of the church is small, about 1/3rd of the college fellowship I used to attend. It was also very energetic, with people jumping around during worship. Party-style celebration worship isn't really my thing, but it did make me so happy to be able to worship God in Japanese. I have secretly loved singing in Japanese, but this time there's actually a meaningful purpose to doing it. Most songs were unfamiliar, but there was one that I used to often sing (but translated to Japanese!). <br><br><br>

		The people exude enthusiasm and joy, which is something that has been missing in my worship for a long time. Recently there's been a lot of heartache, uncertainty, and distrust in myself and in other Christians, but it's refreshing to just be happy in His presence and celebrate the fact that I'm here, and look forward to what he might show me in the future. <br><br><br>

		Afterward, I joined a student small group. Between the 5 of us, 1 mainly understood Japanese and some only mainly understood English (me), but there were also a couple people who could translate in both directions. Everyone was incredibly kind. We talked about our weeks, our prayer requests, and shared a verse or something that impacted us that week. I was delighted, because even though I was thousands of miles and an ocean away, people do the same thing here as my friends do back home: journal, pray together, try to listen to what God has to say to us and walk with Him in our lives. <br><br><br>

		I happened to be the only girl in the group, but the guys were incredibly considerate in making me feel comfortable. An awareness of gender divide seemed to be especially pronounced. However, I was thrilled to meet Japanese, Filipino, and Mongolian brothers in Christ. It's a testament to how God is working everywhere. <br><br><br>

		Lifehouse Sendai, filled with strangers but still somehow familiar, did feel a little like home. </div><br><br><br>
