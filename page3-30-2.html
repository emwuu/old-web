		<h1> Night in Downtown Sendai </h1>
		<div> March 30, 2018 </div>

		<div> Sendai Station seemed magical our first day here, but we only had a peek at it before lugging our luggage and our jet-lagged selves to our dorms. Since our neighborhood is dead quiet at night, and school hasn't started yet, to entertain ourselves, my friends and I headed downtown. </div>

		<div> From Tohoku University to Sendai Station, the heart of downtown, it is about half hour by bus. It costs 230 (~$2 USD) one way. It's quickly becoming apparent that transportation will cost me a significant chunk of change. Many students opt to buy a bike for easy access to both campus and downtown. However, the streets are hilly and claustrobically narrow, so I'm still debating if I want to buy a bike. </div>

		<div> The station is always bustling with activity, with dozens of trains connecting to different parts of the Miyagi prefecture, and shinkansens heading to other major parts of Japan. It's sandwiched between two different malls, has dozens of shops selling beautifully packaged souvenir foods, and many appealing looking restaurants on the basement floor. With how aesthetically pleasing everything is, it can be overwhelming to the eyes (and the wallet). We looked at Japanese snacks at NewsDays, a convenience store common at train stations, trading recommendations. </div>


		<div> Even when you head away from the station and all the indoor shopping malls, there's still MORE SHOPPING. Sendai has its own long trails of 商店街 (covered shopping malls) with restaurants, clothing stores, coffee shops, etc. And arcades. Arcades with their flashing lights, digital sound effects, crane games stuffed with adorable toys and bright colors successfully lure people in.  </div><br>

		<div> After walking for several hours, I was starving and exhausted. My friend and I wanted to be slighty more economical, so we opted for a convenience store dinner instead of a restaurant. By the way, that's not a letdown at all. Convenience store food is delicious, nutritious, and there is SO MUCH VARIETY. I picked up some snacks and a katsudon, which the cashier will always offer to heat up for you. Instant, hot, food that was completely satisfying! </div>
