		<h1> Shiroishi </h1>
		<h3> 白石　</h3>
		<div> May 12, 2018 </div>
		<div>  One of the classes that I'm currently taking is a Japanese Culture class. This is an awesome class that allows us to go on local outings every so often. This weekend, we went to Shiroishi as one of those outtings. <Br><Br>

		Our first stop was Shiroishi Castle. This castle is not the original castle; it was reconstructed after being dismantled at the end of the Edo era. As we learned in class, the reason why so many castles were dismantled is because Japan wanted to catch up with the rest of the Western world, and viewed keeping the castles as "holding on to the past". Later on, Shiroishi regretted letting go of this crucial part of their culture, and opted to rebuild the castle with funds that approximately equate to 1/5th of its annual budget. <Br><Br>

		I can understand why citizens were willing to spend so much rebuilding the castle; the castle definitely gives the town character and adds to the beauty of the surrounding area. I thought the architecture of the castle was remarkable, how nails were only used for the floor boards and most of the castle was constructed from fitting together the wooden beams. The stairs were very steep and a little scary, but I suppose that is something that is unique to Japanese castles. The view from the top was gorgeous, and the whole castle gave off a sense of peace. I don't think this a castle that rakes in entrance fees, nor is it one that is tourist heavy. But I liked how we had the entire castle essentially to ourselves. The emptiness of the upper floors helped me imagine a little more about what it must've been like in the past, separating it from the touristy scene that I've witnessed while visiting other castles. <Br><Br>

		I loved our walk from the castle to the samurai house. Seeing the actual house, I was so impressed that the last occupant managed to live there in the 80s! There's no central heating, electricity, or bathroom that I was aware of. The doors were lined with paper instead of glass. Nevertheless, it was comfy and aesthetically pleasing. <Br><Br>

		 My favorite part about the entire city is the castle moat that runs through it. The constant sound of water rushing was pleasant, and the green moss at the bottom of the moat was fascinating. I loved how the network of water that runs through town. The moat helps give the environment a rustic, older feel. <Br><Br>

		 We also visited a traditional Japanese dance class held by a dance master, who also has an important administrative role in the upcoming Tokyo 2020 Olympic committee. The kids in class were so cute! They all wore traditional Japanese yukata. I wanted to take pictures and video of the kids, but I felt a little awkward doing it, as they aren't zoo animals. However, seeing my teacher do it, I ended up taking some footage (sheepishly). Although the teacher was teaching the kids fundamentals, she did it with such beauty and grace. <Br><Br>

		We also had an amazing lunch, at a restaurant that resembled a traditional home. It had a small Buddhist(?) family altar and many family pictures. It was a curious aesthetic for a restaurant that is open to the public. <Br><Br>

		Lastly, we also got a quick lecture and demonstration about Japanese katana, by swordmaster Miyagi-san (which is also the name of the prefecture we live in!!) We got to hold the katana (they're sharp, no kidding around while holding them)
		I'm really thankful to able to witness everything we saw on this day. There was a lot of natural beauty and charm to Shiroishi that I was in awe of. </div>
