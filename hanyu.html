		<div> April 22, 2018 </div>
		<div> Yuzuru Hanyu, two time Olympic gold medalist in men's figure skating,is a Japanese national hero. To commemorate his recent victory in this year's olympics, his hometown, which happens to be Sendai (!), held a parade in his honor. The event was broadcast on national TV. 
     	Even 3 hours before, as I was on my way to church, fans were already baking in the sun to secure front row seats to the parade. The streets were packed; people came from all over Japan to see him. In fact, the very next day I conducted some interviews for a Japanese assignment at Aoba Castle, and one my questions was why they were at Sendai Castle. All three people I interviewed had come to Sendai to see Hanyu, and two of these people (unrelated) bussed all the way from Kyushu (20 hours)! Crazy, loyal fans!</div><br><br>

     	<p> 3 hours before the parade </p>

     	<div> I'm not crazy or loyal, but I certainly felt like it. I was famished, and the sun seared my skin in the 30-40 minutes I waited for the parade. I also had no idea if I was even going to get a visual on him because of the sheer amount of people. I didn't even know what street the parade was on, but just deposited myself where the police were busy doing crowd control. </div>

     	<div>My paltry efforts (compared to the true fans) were still rewarded because I did get to see him. The parade consisted of a sole vehicle driving a raised platform, where stood Hanyu, tiny and rice-sized in the distance with a gold medal flashing on his neck as he waved enthusiastically to the crowds. He was very adorable.</div><br><br>

     	<p> Trying to escape, after the parade </p>

     	<div>Even after the (short!) parade was over, downtown was very much still Hanyu-themed. Businesses posted papers in the window congratulating and thanking Hanyu for his victory. One shoutengai (covered shopping mall) was playing music from his free skate program. Another displayed huge HD posters of Hanyu. Volunteers were handing out newsprint articles on him “Only one per person" they said on repeat , complete with gorgeous color shots of his Olympic skate. Peddlers were selling his biographies in the street. </div>

    	<p>In all of his glory</p>

    	<div>Upon turning in to another covered shopping mall, I found something not Hanyu themed, but equally exciting - Haikyuu cut-outs! Haikyuu is a popular sports manga serialized in Shounen Jump. It's set in the Miyagi prefecture (where Sendai is the capital), and one particular game is set in the Sendai Gym. Hilariously, they were also handing out a newsprint article -- covering the main characters' fictional victory in the prefectural tournament that secured them a ticket to nationals. </div>

    	<p>Hanyu's article, HOT off the press. That picture must've been taken just an hour ago!</p>

    	<p>影山</p>

    	<div> I was starving, but given that there's so many people in town, there's a line out the door for pretty much everything. Today was definitely not a good day to explore downtown Sendai. I took a bathroom break at a convenience store and grabbed a parfait while I was at it </div>

    	<div class="centered-img"><img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ftEx9Vkl0ovi3_y4swrhuPkQ7LHvV9DFBkM1EHCMwQdpA36tM5yVUepCs8AA6yOKd7tDIRMCndXoI9Ta9t7uH_MYNIHFizP14GuatgPj_vMqPynKl9PmCNR-t6J3IVGLWRpbJmSGdQ=w2400' width="1000"/></div>
    	<p> From Mini Stop! Not something to write home about (frozen fruit), but good presentation. </p>

    	<p> Oddly sweet - This sign at the convenience store says: Thank you for using our bathroom. Please come use our bathroom again. </p>


     	<div>Although I had barely even heard of Sendai before researching study abroad programs, I find it amazing how the things I like from Japan are so closely tied to it. I'm so stoked to be here and am so glad that I chose this program in particular!</div>
