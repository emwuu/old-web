		<h1> Cindy and Ethan Visit</h1>
		<h3> シンジーとイーサンは私を見に来た！</h3>
		<div> April 7-8, 2018 </div>
		<div class="right-text"> The entirety of the Tohoku region is not really a foreign tourist hub, so I feel so blessed that my sister and brother-in-law went out of their way to visit me in Sendai.<br><br>
     	Every region in Japan boasts some kind of specialty, which is a genius marketing tactic and is probably why Japan is so successful at both domestic and international tourism. Sendai is no exception, and is famous for zunda, a sweetened edamame paste, and gyutan, beef tongue. We had a nice meal at Gyutan Rikyu, enjoying gyutan in many different forms, cold and hot. It's delicious and is definitely worth a try, but not particularly memorable or something I would crave in the future.<br>

		<div>  My brother-in-law is a fan of Baked, and he bought these cheese tarts from inside Sendai Station. Creamy and heavenly!</div>

		<div>The next morning, after showing them my dorm room, we walked to Osaki Hachimangu, the biggest Shinto shrine in Sendai. It was my second time visiting but it looked vastly different from before- in the span of just  week, non-descript branches transformed in to a handsome canopy of cherry blossoms! The contrast between the flowers and red Shinto gate completed the shrine 'n sakura aesthetic. The best part about enjoying these cherry blossoms is that it wasn't crowded at all. <br><br></div>

		<p>Two photos, one week apart! Just a week ago when I came here with friends, there were no cherry blossoms!</p>

		<div>Later in the day, we also stumbled upon Nishi Park's cherry blossom festival (sakura matsuri). As Nishi Park is in downtown Sendai, it's a popular spot for hanami. It was a very lively and densely packed event, with food stall lines overlapping in confusing ways. </div>

		<div class="centered-img"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZL9oTu4sHYaXfxiokfUYcJIHBxa4B92buiUvLHLofX00B2w9XHqmPVIKOtbhczRUzSyKa_cynQrBniT9Zf2z0LmamWS_xltNRMEKBM1DpZdegFsTAdTxugF6d7avxMxRBKSLmQtwdQ=w2400" width=1000></div>

		<div>A pair of men cut me in line saying out loud to themselves in Japanese "This should be the end of the line shouldn't it?" However, although I could understand what they were saying, I didn't know how to rebut them in Japanese. Luckily, the woman in front of me came to the rescue, straightfowardly informing them that in fact, the end of the line for takoyaki was all the way back there.  "ね？(Right?)" She looked to me for agreement, but all I could do was smile gratefully at her. Ah, these moments where I regret my lack of language proficiency are all too common! There's only so much I can convey with my body language and face.<Br><br>

		At last the three of us managed to grab some food, and chowed down on okonomiyaki, takoyaki, and soba before going to check out a church in the area. <br><br></div>
