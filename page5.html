		<h1> Neighborhood Snooping </h1>
		<div> March 30, 2018 </div>
		<div></div>

			<div> Near the Tohoku University dorms is an opulent, red brick university campus. However, this university right on our doorstep is not ours! 

			Tohoku Fukushi University is a private school famous for physical education, and many athletes attend this university. It has a grand, crimson driveway and is ostentatiously built on a hill. 

			We were a little intimdated by the security guards at the gates, but they waved us through without fuss. Upon entering, we saw students practicing dance performances and heard cheerleading in preparation for the ceremony. </div>

			<p>このキャンパスはきれいだけど、ちょっと派手すぎかな？</p>

			<p>Traditional architecture in the school!?</p>

			<div> The area we live in is what I assume to be a typical urban neighborhood in Japan. The roads are hilly, houses and apartment buildings are crunched together with no space for backyards. Family restaurants, businesses, and clinics are every block or so, and convenience stores are plentiful. Having already seen a 7-11 and Family Mart nearby, my new friend and I hunted for a rumored local Lawson. These are the big 3 convenience store chains in Japan!<br><br>

			We came across a mother-daughter pair looking for Tohoku University housing, as the daughter was an incoming 1st year physics student. How strange it is to be new to the country and be asked for directions! My friend pulled her superior Japanese skills out of her back pocket, brushed off a little of the hesitancy, and chatted happily with the pair. I could pick most of the conversation, but was too slow to think of replies. Nevertheless, I was happy for the opportunity to listen in and participate in their pre-college excitement. </div>

			<p>Seen in the neighborhood!</p>

			<div> I was thrilled and surprised to see a torii gate over a set of mystical-looking stairs in an unassuming back alley. Although perhaps I shouldn't have been- churches are everywhere in America, and perhaps it is a common trait of humans to have signs of spirtuality intertwined in daily life. It's just that shrines are an unfamiliar sight, and have such distinctive architecture, making the streets look more authentically Japanese. We climbed all the way up to be welcomed to a dilapidated house with an odd net of toys decorating its entrance way, and a small shrine. I marveled at this peaceful oasis sheltered by trees in the middle of a crowded residential neighborhood. </div>

			<div>An elderly man, watering a nearby garden and was evidently the shrine's caretaker, noticed us and chatted amicably with us.<br><br>

			"This is the shrine to Amaterasu," he said "have you heard of him? He’s the most powerful god in the area. The second biggest shrine is just over there, and that other god's shrine is over there, but this shrine dedicated to the strongest god in the area," he proclaimed proudly.<br><br>

			My friend asked him how to worship this god. "Well first you..." he bowed and clapped before the shrine, movements well-practiced. 
			My friend began to copy the ritual. As she was in the middle of bowing, the caretaker interrupted.<br><br>
			"But all this is futile! Prayers won't do anything! There are no gods!"<br><br>

			<i>Huh!? But weren't you just bragging about taking care of the strongest god in the area?</i><br><br>

			The old man continues to talk about his disbelief, "They're not really listening. It's futile to believe in these things, don't you think so? You'd think something would have happened by now with all the prayers. Do you have a religion? It's just superstition" This is when I begin to suspect that religion in Japan for many is purely cultural and not out of belief. <br><br>

			We continued to listen to him, as he plowed forward to other topics. I struggled to keep up with his Japanese, difficulty compounded by a casual, Sendai dialect. <br><br>

			"Have you heard Japanese spoken this way before? This is the local speak! What dialect do they teach you in the states?"<br><br>
			"You're exchange students at Tohoku University? You must be smart, that's an elite school!" <br><br>
			"Oh, you're Chinese? Well that's okay, all Asians are the same. They're all born with blue butts"<br><br>

			Gradually, our enthused feelings morphed in to perplexity, and we eventually managed to extricate ourselves from the conversation.<br><br>

			We never did find that Lawson, but I think it was a successful adventure! </div>
